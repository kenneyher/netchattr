# Netchattr

Here's a network program made with python that chats with itself.

To start a netchattr instance you use `python3` and provide a port 
between 5000 and 5100.
```
python3 netchattr.py 5000
```

You will see the following output:
```
Starting netchattr 'john67' on port 5003
```

If you want to see netchattr in action, create as many instances 
as you want (as long as they don't have the same port and it is 
between 5000 and 5100).

Then you will see something like this:
```
Starting netchattr 'raymondhall' on port 5002

JOHN67: Able military try security side sense.

JOHN67: Thousand begin true worry buy pressure.
```
